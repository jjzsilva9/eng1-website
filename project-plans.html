            During the course of our project we made plans that were updated weekly by one of our team members. This helped us to judge if everything was on track and also was a good way to document
            any changes and keep track of each member's workload. The plan did change through the course as the gantt charts show below but as we reached
            week 3 and started implementation the tasks remained the same. <br>
