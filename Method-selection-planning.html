    <h2>Method Selection and Planning</h2>
    <a href="index.html">&lt;&lt;Back to main page</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>When deciding on a method to follow during the course of the software development we came to the conclusion that an agile framework would be the best
        as it allows for requirements to change which would be happening in the future of the assessment.
        More specifically we decided we would use Scrum throughout the project, which consisted of dividing the work into sprints each with their own planning meeting.
        After research, we came to the decision to use libGDX as our game engine for the project as it provided good support for Java along with multiple sets of tools for creating 2D games which related well to our project.
        We chose IntelliJ as our IDE for the development of the game as it coupled well with libGDX and was familiar to some members of the group.

    <h4>Work breakdown</h4>
    <p>To begin our software engineering process our team decided to break down the project into different tasks using a UML diagram. The project was split by deliverables and then further split down into broad tasks that needed to be complete to fulfil each deliverable.<br>
    This diagram can be seen here:

    <br>
    <h4>Task Breakdown</h4>
    <p>For each work package elicited in the work breakdown, we analysed and split it down further into tasks.
    This would allow us to create a more in depth and relaistic timeline for our deliverables. <br>
    The task table can be seen below:

    <h4>Project Plans</h4>
    <p>Once we had a clear vision of the work that needed to be done we could figure out a time frame.
        To create this project schedule Gantt chart was used as it was the most appropriate tool to provide a graphical overview of work-packages, tasks, deliverables and milestones along with timings around the timescale of the project.
        As suspected, the initial plan did have some changes made to it throughout the project because of different factors: some tasks took longer than others, members of the team falling ill and more focus was needed on other tasks.
        To document these changes the Gantt chart was updated weekly. <br>
        All the weekly gantt charts can be seen below:
