    <h2>Risk Managment and Mitigation</h2>
    <a href="index.html">&lt;&lt;Back to main page</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>To carry out the project risk assessment and formulate our risk register, our team followed
        the four step risk management process which involves the identification, analysis, planning,
        and monitoring of potential risks.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Identification</h4>
    <p>The risk management process began with risk identification where two of our team members
        worked to create a list of possible risks to the project.
        The list of risks was then categorised into groups by type. For example, the
        Estimation risks discussed potential issues relating to the scheduling of our project. This
        grouping helped us to identify gaps and overlaps in our initial list of risks as well as spot risks
        that were unnecessary to consider. </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Analysis</h4>
    <p>The risks were then analysed one by one. This was done by
        rating each riskâ€™s likelihood and severity on the scale of low, moderate, and high. We
        decided not to use a more fine-grained classification system because it felt unnecessary for
        the risks we devised.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Planning</h4>
    <p>Following that, the
        team proceeded to the planning stage where we agreed on protocols for each risk in order to
        mitigate its effects. Each risk was also assigned an owner to monitor occurrences of that risk
        and to ensure the correct protocol is followed to handle it.
        In order to increase the bus
        factor for our risk mitigation strategy, it was decided that secondary owners would be
        allocated to each risk. Furthermore, a single
        type of risk had multiple team members allocated to it with the purpose of ensuring that each
        risk type still received attention if a member of the team became unavailable.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Monitoring</h4>
    <p>Throughout the project, the owners monitored their corresponding risks, keeping note of the
        statuses of each risk and recording the dates of risk occurrences. This was accomplished as
        the beginning of our weekly Thursday group meetings was allocated to reading through the
        risk register and discussing the status of each risk.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Risk Register</h4>
    <p>Our risk register is organised in a spreadsheet where each row represents a project risk.
        Each risk is specified by its own ID and a description of what the risk is on the project and is
        categorised by its risk type. The risk register contains ratings given for the likelihood and
        severity of each risk as well as the mitigation strategy to be followed in the event of the risk
        occurring. <br>
        The risk register can be seen below:
