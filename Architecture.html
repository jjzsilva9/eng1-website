    <h4>CRC Cards - first iteration</h4>
    <p>To begin this process we decided to use responsibility driven design as its principles of maximising abstraction and preserving flexibility were well suited to our project brief, as the game is simple and we knew we had to prepare for change in assessment 2. <br>
        We followed the process of RDD by producing CRC, class responsibilities and collaborators, cards which held information about the concepts of our game. <br>
        We then grouped the cards into concepts that related to each other and from these groups we were able to identify concepts that performed the same task so elimated some concepts. <br>
        To further understand the concepts we created we identified the responsibilities of each and also what other concepts they would be collaborating with. From this process we were able to justify why each component was needed in the system and it also made it clear which were needed and which were desirable.

    <h4>Initial Class diagram</h4>
    <p>The main aim of using the CRC cards was to make the creation of the UML class diagram easier. This was useful as the roles we had identified could be transformed into methods of each class and the collaborators for each concept meant that there would have to be a relationship between them. <br>
    We used the first iteration of CRC cards to create the initial class diagram below

    <h4>CRC cards - second iteration</h4>
    <p>Once we had started implementation we realised that the framework set out by our class diagram was unrealistic.
        To fix this issue we refined the CRC cards into a structure that was more suited to the game engine environment and refined the amount of concepts we had originally created as these were not required for this part of the project. <br>
        After another iteration of the RDD process we produced a new set of refined cards which can be seen below:

    <br>
    <h4>Final Class Diagram</h4>
    <p>Using the second iteration of CRC cards, we were able to produce another class diagram. This second version matched the framework of LibGDX better
    so it could be used by the coding team during implementation. <br>The new diagram can be seen below:

    <h4>Behaviour Diagrams</h4>
    <p>To demonstrate how our system works we created sequence diagrams. These were useful as they provided a visual run throuh of how the system should function,
    meaning that the coding team were able to compare their work to the diagrams as a basic form of testing. <br>
    The diagrams created can be seen below:

    <h4>System Diagrams</h4>
    <p>Within our game class we have severel systems each to handle different parts of the implementation. To model what each system is expected to do
    we created system diagrams. These show how each system interacts with other components of the game making it easier to implement.<br>
    The system diagrams can be seen below:

    <h4>Requirements</h4>
    <p>Once we had decided how the game would be implemented with the use of modelling with various diagrams, it was important to check that all requirments were being met.
    To do this we created a table listing all the requirements then listed which parts of our suggested implemtation would deliver them. This ensured not only
    that all requirements were being et but also that each part of the implementation was justified. <br>
    The table can be seen below:
