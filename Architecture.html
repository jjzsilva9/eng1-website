    <h4>CRC Cards - first iteration</h4>
    <p>To begin this process we decided to use responsibility driven design as its principles of maximising abstraction and preserving flexibility were well suited to our project brief, as the game is simple and we knew we had to prepare for change in assessment 2. <br>
        We followed the process of RDD by producing CRC, class responsibilities and collaborators, cards which held information about the concepts of our game. <br>
        We then grouped the cards into concepts that related to each other and from these groups we were able to identify concepts that performed the same task so elimated some concepts. <br>
        To further understand the concepts we created we identified the responsibilities of each and also what other concepts they would be collaborating with. From this process we were able to justify why each component was needed in the system and it also made it clear which were needed and which were desirable.

    <h4>Initial Class diagram</h4>
    <p>The main aim of using the CRC cards was to make the creation of the UML class diagram easier. This was useful as the roles we had identified could be transformed into methods of each class and the collaborators for each concept meant that there would have to be a relationship between them. <br>
    We used the first iteration of CRC cards to create the initial class diagram below
